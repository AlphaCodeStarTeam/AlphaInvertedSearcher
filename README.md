Hi! This is Alpha Team speaking. The following is a quick review of what we did for our C# Inverted-Index Search Engine and what you can expect while checking our project.
This project is result of using lots of caffeine, sleepless nights and a lot of efforts from:

## Use Cases
A quick concept of this search engine would be searching a word in a large scale database like google. there would be many website which include that specific word in one their articles and google must give you the articles that contain the specific word.
Now imagine you have bunch of text , document, or even string items in your program and you need to get the items that include specific words. you could easily do that with our search engine.
